# Model Monitoring: Input Stability

After running the script ```tractor_input_stability.R```,
this folder will contain several images to calculate the 
population stability index for each of the explanatory variables
of a predictive model over several years. 

The changes in distributions are evaluated with the  
Pearson's Chi-Squared statistic and Kullback-Leibler Divergence,
and then through comparing histograms.
