### Design Considerations

Different perspectives and considerations should be applied 
when developing a production system by contrasting the needs of research implementations. 
An overview of design considerations (performance requirements and compute requirements) 
consists of four phases
(figure 1.4):
-	Project setup is the process of figuring out as much detail as possible about the 
problem at hand. The methods of doing this are couched as a discussion in a 
technical interview, and the source of information is seen as the interviewer. 
Goals, user experience, performance constraints, evaluation, personalization, 
and project constraints (people, compute power, and infrastructure) are identified as significant elements to be considered. 
-	The data pipeline element considers privacy and bias, storage, preprocessing, 
and availability.
-	Modelling is considered in terms of model selection, training, debugging, hyperparameter tuning and scaling (in the sense of covering a large amount of training data). 
-	Serving is framed in terms of the evaluation of the model and the assumptions 
that we need to understand when running the model in the field.

# Chapter 2: Pre-Project: From Opportunity to Requirements

This chapter covers
-	Understanding the project type and the 
stakeholders' expectations of scale and 
structure
-	Setting up a pre-sales/pre-project process
-	Understanding requirements for model 
performance 
-	Understanding data assets
-	Understanding the project's general 
requirements
-	Coming to grips with the tools and 
infrastructure to deliver successfully

## Summary

-	A structured process to develop a project is necessary if you are going to successfully manage risk.
-	It's important to understand how to manage the project and to comprehend the 
required project management infrastructure.
-	ML projects have particular features that need to be captured as requirements.
-	Particular attention needs to be paid to the data assets that will underpin the 
project, as well as getting a picture of what data is available. 
-	Itâ€™s important to understand how the data will be accessed and what capability is 
available to manipulate and prepare it for use by ML.
-	We need to understand specific requirements about the security and privacy of 
the data asset; this can introduce higher costs into the project.
-	A well-understood and fit-for-purpose development infrastructure is needed, and 
the IT architecture that the project is going to be delivered into needs to be clear.
-	Specific consideration to the corporate responsibility and ethical aspects of the 
project should be built in from the beginning.

# Chapter 3: Pre-Project: From Requirements to Proposal


This chapter covers
-	Creating a project hypothesis 
-	Generating an estimate for effort and time 
-	Doing the paperwork to get the project 
underway 
-	Completing your pre-sales checklist

## Pre-project/pre-sales checklist






## Summary
-	To get to a proposal for the project, the requirements need to be transformed 
into a hypothesis that spells out the expected outcome and key challenges.
-	A structured process of estimation can then be done based on the hypothesis and 
the information about the delivery environment that you gathered in chapter 2.
-	An useful estimate takes into account the team's structure and the commitment 
needed to meet the requirements.
-	Get your project documentation properly reviewed and signed off before anyone 
mentions costs to the customer.
-	If the pre-project phase fails, then it's certain that the project would have failed, 
and that is far worse.
