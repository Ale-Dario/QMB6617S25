# Chapter 2: Data Science Companies

## Introduction

This chapter covers
- Types of companies hiring data scientists
- The pros and cons of each company type 
- The tech stacks you may see at different jobs



### Introduction to Data Science Roles

Data science includes various roles: 
- research scientist, 
- machine learning engineer, 
- business intelligence analyst, etc.

Work varies by role and is influenced by the company.

Influence of Company Characteristics:
- Company size (big vs. small), 
- industry (tech vs. traditional), and 
- age (young vs. established) 


These characteristics affect:
- Project focus
- Supporting technology
- Team culture

### Aim of the Chapter:

To provide insight into typical companies for data scientists.

Presentation of Fictional Companies:
- Five fictional companies will be showcased that hire data scientists.
- These companies are based on research and experiences.
- The examples illustrate principles applicable across the industry.
- Understanding these archetypes aids in assessing potential employers.

- Managers balance requests for immediate data science work with long-term innovative initiatives.
- MTC's financial resources allow for greater investment in innovation and research and development.


### The tech: Advanced, but siloed across the company

Overview of Technology Diversity at MTC

- MTC is a large organization that relies on various technologies.
- Different departments utilize different data storage technologies.
- Example: One uses Microsoft SQL Server; another uses Apache Hive.
- Data indexing varies by department, leading to disjointed records.

Challenges for Data Scientists at MTC

- Data scientists must learn MTC-specific querying and data usage methods.
- Knowledge gained is often not transferable to other companies.

Tools and Technologies Used

- Data scientists may use multiple tools, including:
- Major programming languages like R and Python (widely supported).
- Less common languages, depending on managerial approval (e. g. , Haskell).
- Rare usage of paid languages like SAS or SPSS.

Machine Learning Stack Variability

- The machine learning stack differs across departments.
- Some teams use advanced methods (microservices, containers) for model deployment.
- Others rely on outdated systems.

### The pros and cons of MTC

Job Overview at MTC
- Working at MTC as a data scientist is prestigious.
- There is a clear understanding of the data scientist role within the company.
- Support network exists due to a high number of data scientists.
- Access to required resources is generally straightforward.
- Rarely experience isolation or difficulty in getting help.

Challenges of the Role
- Complex tech stack makes navigation difficult.
- Projects may use languages or systems you arenâ€™t familiar with.
- Harder to stand out due to a large number of data scientists.
- Fewer unique project opportunities as many are already started.

Job Security
- MTC offers more job security than a startup environment.
- Layoffs are possible but less common.
- Managers usually prefer reassigning employees over firing them.

Specialization
- Many specialized roles exist within the company (e. g. , data engineers, market researchers).
- This allows for delegation of tasks outside your expertise.
- Limits opportunities to expand your skill set.

Bureaucracy
- Getting approvals for projects and resources can be time-consuming.
- Projects may be canceled due to internal conflicts among executives.

Opportunities
- Great for data scientists interested in solving big problems with new techniques.
- Budget available for innovative solutions.
- Contributions are valued, even if not in a decision-making role.

Suitability for Decision-Makers
- Not ideal for data scientists wanting to lead or decide independently.
- Must adhere to established protocols and structures.
