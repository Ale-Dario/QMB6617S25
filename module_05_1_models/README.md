## Summary

Create informative features for consumption by the ML algorithms in the modelling phase.
-	Create additional training data with data augmentation to support more robust 
models. 
-	Develop an understanding of the design forces on a model. 
-	Make purposeful and effective choices about the components of models that you 
want to develop. 
-	Understand and use inductive bias to inform your approach to modelling. Consider using hierarchical, grid-based, recurrent, graph-based, or attention-based 
structures. 
-	Determine when to use composite models and how to structure them effectively 
to solve the problem at hand. 
-	Structure and manage a controlled and purposeful modelling process.
-	Track and manage the evolution of models using automated tools. 
-	Detect and determine models that should be immediately rejected based on 
their behavior or structure.
