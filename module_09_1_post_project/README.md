## Summary

-	Its likely that the team will get called on to support the system they developed. 
Over time, this demand will likely taper off, and other folks will take on the 
remaining tasks. Sometimes these people will be junior members in your team. 
-	Work to get clarity about what systems you are responsible for supporting. 
Remember, the resources required to look after them are allocated somewhere 
in the organization, and by all rights, they should go where the responsibility lies. 
-	Get a grip on the systems that you have responsibility for. Ensure that proper governance and support arrangements are in place and that there is a plan to deal 
with them if they go wrong. Review all systems regularly.
-	Identify and deal with technical debt. Especially ensure that all systems are properly instrumented so that you know how they are behaving and that there is information available to troubleshoot if there is a failure. 
-	If a system fails, then get organized. Convene a group to support you and act as 
quickly as you can to get it fixed. 
-	Run project reviews to learn from what happened and to support development 
in your team. 
-	Ensure that your team has access to learning and development opportunities in 
the light of what's happening in the project. 
-	Develop your own point of view on the issues that this book has covered, then 
share them with me and other people who will need your insight if they are to 
succeed in the future.
