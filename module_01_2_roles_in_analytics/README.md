# Sec. 1.2: Data Science Jobs


## Different types of data science jobs 

Core Skills of Data Science
- Three core skills: analytics, machine learning, and decision science
- Skills can be mixed and matched for various data science jobs
- Each area serves a different purpose and delivers unique outcomes

Job Search Insights
- Focus on job descriptions over titles when looking for data science jobs
- Pay attention to interview questions
- Examine the backgrounds of individuals in data science roles
- Similar job titles may have different responsibilities
- Variation in titles may exist across companies

### Analytics

Role of an Analyst
- Takes data and presents it to relevant stakeholders
- Formats information for management to track progress on yearly goals
- Builds dashboards with features to filter data by country or product type
- Involves data cleaning and preparation
- Spotting and fixing data quality issues is part of the job
- Main decision-making is done by business partners

Skills and Responsibilities
- The role might be seen as outside data science due to less emphasis on statistics and machine learning
- Developing visualizations and data transformations requires skills akin to data science
- Tasks include creating automated dashboards to track subscriber changes over time
- Must determine appropriate data and transformation methods for clarity
- Creates compelling dashboards that update daily without errors

Summary of Analyst’s Work
- An analyst creates dashboards and reports that deliver data.

### Machine learning

Role of a Machine Learning Engineer
- Develops machine learning models and puts them into production.
- Optimizes algorithms for search results on e-commerce sites.
- Creates recommendation systems.
- Monitors model performance to ensure quality after deployment.
- Focuses more on programming work rather than visualizations.

Differences from Other Data Science Roles
- Work is primarily for machine use, not for human analysis.
- Often creates APIs for machine interaction.
- Closer to software development than traditional data science roles.

Coding Practices
- Must follow best coding practices for performance and collaboration.
- Code should be tested and easy for others to understand.
- Many come from a computer science background.

Example Task
- May need to create a model that predicts customer behavior on a website in real time.
- Involves using historical data, training a model, turning it into an API, and deploying it.
- Responsible for fixing issues if the model fails.

Summary Statement
- A machine learning engineer creates models that run continuously.

### Decision science

Role of a Decision Scientist
- Translates raw data into useful information for decision-making
- Requires deep knowledge of mathematical and statistical methods
- Familiar with business decision-making processes
- Creates visualizations to aid understanding for nontechnical audiences
- Code is often run once for specific analyses, allowing for inefficiencies

Understanding Company Needs
- Listens to the needs of other company members
- Generates beneficial information based on requests
- Example: Assists marketing director in selecting products for a holiday gift guide
- Investigates product sales, collaborates with research teams, and applies behavioral science

Deliverables
- Produces reports or presentations for product managers and executives

Statistical Decision-Making
- Uses statistics to aid decision-making under uncertainty
- Manages company’s experimentation analytics system
- Conducts A/B tests to assess effectiveness of changes

A/B Testing
- Randomly assigns users to different conditions (control vs treatment)
- Compares actions taken by users in each group
- Cautions against premature conclusions based on slight differences in metrics

Conclusion
- Decision scientists create analyses that lead to actionable recommendations.


### Related jobs

Additional Data Science Roles

- There are other data science roles beyond the main three types discussed.
- It is helpful to be aware of these distinct positions.
- Collaboration may be necessary with colleagues in these roles.
- The book content may be less pertinent for those interested in these additional roles.


#### BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE ANALYST

Business Intelligence Analyst Overview
- Role is similar to that of an analyst
- Uses less statistical and programming skills
- Common tool is Excel instead of Python
- Creates less complex outputs due to tool limitations

Job Considerations
- Frustration for those wanting to do machine learning or programming
- Limited opportunities for skill development
- Typically lower pay and prestige than data science jobs

Career Path
- Good entry point to becoming a data scientist
- Recommended for those with no business data experience
- Look for positions offering skill development in programming languages like R or Python

#### DATA ENGINEER

Data Engineer Role

- Focuses on maintaining data in databases
- Ensures accessibility of data for users
- Does not run reports, make analyses, or develop models
- Keeps data stored and formatted in well-structured databases

Responsibilities

- Maintains customer records in cloud databases
- Adds new tables as requested
- Builds backend components for internal experimentation systems
- Updates data processing flows for efficiency
- Develops and monitors batch and streaming environments

Skills Required

- Strong computer science skills required
- Many data engineers have backgrounds as software engineers

Comparison to Data Scientists

- Data engineers differ significantly from data scientists
- Data engineers are more rare and in demand

#### RESEARCH SCIENTIST

Research Scientist Role
- Develops and implements new tools, algorithms, and methodologies
- Tools primarily used by other data scientists in the company

Education Requirements
- Typically requires a PhD
- Common fields include computer science, statistics, quantitative social science, or related areas

Research Activities
- May spend weeks researching methods to enhance online experiments
- Aims for improvements like 1% more accuracy in image recognition for self-driving cars
- May develop new deep learning algorithms

Publication of Research
- Writes research papers that may not be used internally
- Helps increase company prestige and advance the field
