# Chapter 1: What makes a successful data scientist?

## Sec 1.1: Data scientist expectations

The Data Science Venn Diagram:
- Drew Conway introduced the diagram in 2010.
- It highlights three essential skills for success in data science.


<img src="Images/HLDS_Venn.png" width="750"/>


Three Pillars of Data Science Skills:
- Math and statistics knowledge.
- Hacking skills.
- Substantive expertise.


Dr. Conway later founded multiple technology companies, including Datakind, Sum,
and Alluvium. Countless blogs and books have since referenced the Venn diagram he
introduced. By 2021, over 200,000 DS practitioners worldwide earned the title of data
scientist. How has the field evolved?

### The Venn diagram a decade later

Updates on DS Venn Diagram
- Many original terms from 2010 are still valid but have seen updates and debates.
- Variations of the DS Venn diagram are plentiful in image searches.

Expansion of Data Scientist Role
- The role of a data scientist has significantly broadened since its start.
- By 2021, math and statistics knowledge has evolved into a general technology capability.
- Technology capability includes tools for effective project leadership, problem framing, data understanding, feature engineering, modeling strategies, and setting success expectations.

Hacking Skills Evolution
- Hacking skills have expanded to execution capabilities.
- Now includes practices for defining projects from vague requirements.
- Also involves prioritizing and planning projects while balancing trade-offs like speed vs. quality and safety vs. accountability.

Substantive Expertise Development
- Substantive expertise now means having expert knowledge to align projects with organizational goals.
- Must understand data source nuances and navigate structural challenges for successful project launches.

Challenges in Finding Qualified Data Scientists
- Difficult to find individuals who excel in all three pillars of a data scientist.
- Data scientists with academic backgrounds may only be strong in technology.
- Industry-experienced data scientists can learn execution practices but might lack in other areas.
- Seasoned practitioners with both domain expertise and experience are rare but highly valuable.

### What is missing?

Hiring Challenges in Data Science Teams
- Hiring practices had blind spots.
- Candidates often vetoed in final interviews or needed to be managed out.
- Failures were often labeled as “not a cultural fit. ”
- Important to analyze what “cultural fit” means in the Data Science (DS) field.

Understanding Culture in Data Science
- Distinction between DS culture, organizational culture, and industry culture is necessary.
- This book expands the assessment of data scientists beyond capabilities to include virtues.

Virtues in Data Science

Virtues are habits developed over time, 
with three key dimensions of virtues emphasized:
- Ethics: Standards of conduct to avoid breakdowns in work ethic.
- Rigor: Craftsmanship ensuring trust in results; results should be repeatable and testable.
- Attitude: Approach to workplace situations, emphasizing positivity, curiosity, and respect.

Practicing Virtues
- Virtues should be practiced in moderation.
- Excessive rigor can lead to analysis paralysis; too little can produce flawed conclusions.

## Sec. 1.2: Career progression in data science

Work Environment of Data Scientists

- In 2020, around 33% of data scientists worked in companies with 30 or more data scientists.
- Large companies, with mature processes for interviewing and career growth, make up 1% of all companies employing data scientists.
- 67% of data scientists are in companies with fewer than 30 team members, representing 99% of these companies.

Career Progression Challenges

- Career paths for data scientists in the majority of companies may not be clear.
- Many companies organize their data science functions in centralized or distributed structures.
- Distributed structures can limit career progression, as data scientists are often viewed as a support function.
- Lack of managers with data science expertise in distributed teams hinders growth opportunities.

Centralized Teams and Career Clarity

- In centralized teams, career progression may still be unclear without moving into management roles.
- The distinction in career stages is based on the scope of influence and positive organizational impact.

<img src="Images/HLDS_Career_Paths.png" width="750"/>

As of 2021, very few companies have established a formal DS career track, let alone
a DS individual contributor career development track.

# Chapter 16: Moving Up the ladder

The management option is what most people think of when they think about
career growth. Managers are the people who lead teams, including hiring and promoting,
setting strategy, and giving career mentoring. Principal data scientists are
people who are masters of their field, and companies rely on them to solve difficult
technical problems. Independent consultants are data scientists who have enough
skills and a large-enough network to be able to freelance for a living.

## The management track
