## Summary

Analyses are documents that highlight conclusions and encapsulate important
features of an application of data science to solve a business problem. They are
critical for data scientists.
- A great analysis requires understanding the business problem and how data can
solve it.
- When making the analysis, always think of the end goal, use simple methods
with clear visualizations, and be ready to share your work.
- Managing the process of creating the analysis is important to keep the work
focused on the goal and to ensure that it has a clear end.
