An empirical case study to demonstrate Business Analytics in Action.

This case study illustrates an end-to-end modeling exercise through a series of progressively mode advanced statistical models.
Throughout the development of the analysis, 
close attention is paid to the business decision
and how the interim results suggest tentative recommendations, 
which are refined through the series of models.
